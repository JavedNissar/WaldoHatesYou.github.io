title: Echoes
---
Lately, I've been thinking about using my phone for
rudimentary echolocation.The idea is that I can use
my phone to attain a crappy map of my house by playing a
220 Hz sine wave from my phone's speakers and then
receiving the echo of that sound wave through my phone's
microphone. This should help me detect walls and doors
although I doubt this technique would work on
complex shapes such as tables and chairs. I asked
one of my friends about this idea and he said that the
microphone on my phone would not be capable of detecting
the echo due to background noise. And while I agree that
the background noise will be a problem, I remember reading
that certain signal processing techniques can be used to
filter out undesired sounds from an audio file. It looks
like I'll have to do more research to see if this will
work.
