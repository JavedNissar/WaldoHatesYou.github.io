Perception is king. Every man decides how they see the world; thus, every man has the ability to decide their feelings and their response to the world around them. Therefore, a man should never allow their emotions to get the better of them as an emotion that is not controlled exerts its influence on the mind such that the mind is no longer capable of full judgement. Ultimately, a man should always seek to control his perception of the world as that will enable him to maintain a state of calm and calm is what a man needs to secure peace.
