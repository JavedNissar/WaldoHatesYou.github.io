AltBuild was created because I noticed that I was spending more time than I wanted to creating a zip file of all my builds and uploading that to Slack so I could collaborate with my teammates. So, I created AltBuild so that I could run a list of commands right after a build.

## Features ##
* Choose multiple build platforms and execute a build for all of them with the press of a single button
* Create multiple build profiles
* Declare a list of commands to be run on Terminal (on Mac OSX), or Command Prompt (on Windows).


## Installation ##
To install AltBuild, follow this list of instructions.

1. Create a Unity3D project or open a Unity3D project
2. Download AltBuild from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0r0j2p6qn64lzoh/AltBuild.unitypackage?dl=0).
3. Go to Unity3D's **Assets**
4. Go to **Import Package**
5. Click **Custom Package**. 
6. Find the **AltBuild.unitypackage** file you downloaded earlier and open it.
